INTRODUCTION:
	
   matplotlib is a pure python plotting library designed to bring
   publication quality plotting to python with a syntax familiar to
   matlab users.  Although the goal of publication quality is not yet
   attained (see GOALS), the library does produce high quality 2D
   plots.  All of the plotting commands can be accessed either via a
   functional interface familiar to matlab users or an object oriented
   interface familiar to python users.
   

REQUIREMENTS:

   python 2.2+, pygtk-1.99.16 (requires GTK2) and Numeric-22+

INSTALL

  If you have the requirements, just do 'python setup.py install'.  

EXAMPLES

  See the examples in the examples dir.
