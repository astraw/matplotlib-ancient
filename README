INTRODUCTION:

  This is a gtk based python plotting library which makes a faint
  attempt at emulating matlab style plot commands.  The src is divided
  into 2 parts, located in the src dir.  matplotlib.py is the plotting
  lib which does the heavy lifting, and matplot.py defines some
  functions to give a matlab style functional interface to the plot
  lib, which is suitable for use from the interactive prompt.

REQUIREMENTS:

   python 2.2+, pygtk-1.99.x and Numeric

INSTALL

  If you have the requirements, just do 'python setup.py install'

EXAMPLES

  See the demos in the demo dir.
