-- add print/save functionality.  Currently you can save by right
   clicking on the fig window, but you must have nothing in front of
   the window.  I suppose I need to first draw to a pixbuf.  I would
   also like to control the resolution.  

     UPDATE: high resolution printing.  Resolution can be set from the
     command line, but the GUI needs to be updated to allow resolution
     to be set along with filename

-- fix text size calculations using pango layouts: 

     DONE
 
-- add a font selection dialog for the axis text

-- enable vertical rendering for ylabels: 
     
     DONE

-- enable anti aliasing for fonts: 

     DONE with pango

-- enable fancy text labels (eg, greek letters, math symbols,
   superscripts) ala TeX or unicode

-- add a color selection dialog for the background, lines, and text

-- allow interactive control of the plot from the python shell after
   it has been launched using the cookbook thread recipe.  

      DONE

-- write a user guide

-- allow more intelligent choice of tick labels and locs when panning and
   zooming.

-- figure out why the positioning of dialog boxes based on position
   and size of main window and dialog window doesn't work exactly as
   expected.  For example, the width of the dialog box is being
   reported as being much smaller than it is.  Is window pixels the
   unit being returned by for gtk.Dialogs.get_size?  Also, this isn't
   working cross platform.  According to the docs this is better
   handled using size hints -- but I don't know how to use them, yet.

-- vlines and hlines disappear in some instance due to improper
   clipping

-- One the errorbar demo the hlines do not always appear symmetric
   about the x values.  Is there an tranformation or rounding problem
   occurring somewhere?

-- Clip patches outside view port

   DONE

-- Allow background color to be set for subplots  

   DONE: subplot now takes a kwarg axisbg with color format string
   just as axes does

-- Expose bug on win32 for axis text

-- Fix floating point bug on panx/pany where 0 is computed as 5e-17
   
   UPDATE: hack workaround.  If the distance of the tickloc from the
   nearest integer is a small fraction of the view lim, just use the
   integer

-- fmt process bug on this kind of plot command (2nd of 3 has no
   format string)

   plot(t1, p1, 'o', t2, p2, ogtt.times, ogtt.cpeptide, 's')

   DONE: 2003-05-12 fixed _grab_next_args in figure.py 

-- xlabel is lower than it needs to be

    UPDATE: made a change -- make sure this works

-- interactive setting of x/ylabels doesn't redraw all labels unless
   you click a forced redraw

   DONE 2003-05-12  Removed some of the state handling of text labels
   so they always redraw

-- When you change a property using the OO interface in interactive,
   the figure doesn't know to redraw.  

   Some possibilities:

   1) redraw on all interactive commands.  kind of heavy handled

   2) override setattr on artist to signal a redraw event. kind of
      heavy handled

   3) allow derived classes to signal redraw events when nexessary.
      kind of code intrusive.


-- on exit from interactive.py call gtk. mainquit

   DONE 2003-05-11

-- pan/zoom on axes_demo flushes insets

   DONE 2003-05-11

-- raise the figure returned by figure but don't give it the focus

   DONE 2003-05-12 with window.window.raise_()

-- when you toggle an axes for interactive navigation, make sure a
   checked on appears as the default is one is checked

-- DONE compile pygtk for threads on win32.
  
-- There is a bug in vertical rendering of text that is exposed in the
   text, but not the ylabel, command.  It looks like a pixmap or
   images is not being properly initialized, resulting in pixel noise.

-- DONE Fix the way the color map allocs colors.  Use only one DrawingArea
   instead of creating a new one with each call to ColorDispatcher().
   With this fix the bug in the logo code where the foreground text
   doesn't render to the desired color

-- include manifest file for rpms

-- fix CTRL-z bug in interactive2.py

-- Allow gca not gca(); ditto for gcf()

-- Fix legend to take a vector of line handles

-- Fix legend bug on win32 and stock_demo.  This appears to be GTK
   specific

-- ticks too short with log scaling

-- arbitrary patches for scatter

-- zoom x and y controls in wrong direction.  tick labels not updating
   with interactive zoom
