-- add print/save functionality.  Currently you can save by right
   clicking on the fig window, but you must have nothing in front of
   the window.  I suppose I need to first draw to a pixbuf.  I would
   also like to control the resolution.  

   DONE: just need to make a GUI to set size and fname

-- fix text size calculations using pango layouts: DONE
 
-- add a font selection dialog for the axis text

-- enable vertical rendering for ylabels: DONE

-- enable anti aliasing for fonts: DONE with pango

-- enable fancy text labels (eg, greek letters, math symbols,
   superscripts) ala TeX or unicode

-- add a color selection dialog for the background, lines, and text

-- allow interactive control of the plot from the python shell after
   it has been launched using the cookbook thread recipe.

-- write a user guide

-- allow more intelligent choice of tick labels and locs when panning and
   zooming.

-- figure out why the positioning of dialog boxes based on position
   and size of main window and dialog window doesn't work exactly as
   expected.  For example, the width of the dialog box is being
   reported as being much smaller than it is.  Is window pixels the
   unit being returned by for gtk.Dialogs.get_size?  Also, this isn't
   working cross platform.  According to the docs this is better
   handled using size hints -- but I don't know how to use them, yet.


-- vlines and hlines disappear on in some instance due to improper
   clipping

-- One the errorbar demo the hlines do not always appear symmetric
   about the x values.  Is there an tranformation or rounding problem
   occurring somewhere?

-- Clip patches outside view port

-- Here's a list of things the remaining things I think need to be
   done before publication quality (2D) is achieved

   1) Display fonts vertically (ylabel).  Arbitrary orientations would
      be nicer and would be matlab mimic the matlab handle rotation
      for text.

       Update: vertical text support and ylabel added 2003-05-01

   2) Arbitrary locs for axis text

   3) Legend

   4) Fix ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport

      DONE 2003-05-01 with gc clip

   5) Allow text to scale for high res prints 

   6) Support multiple output resolutions and formats: 

      Updates: Added support for png and jpeg. 2003-05-01  Gdk-Pixbufs
      can support more types, but apparently pygtk only supports these
      2.  This may be GTK or pygtk build dependent.  

   7) Fix the script time render time inconsitencies (like axis lim
      autoscalig which occurs at rendering and is not available during
      script

   8) Allow interactive control of plot thru threading

   9) Support a richer char set for labeling, eg greek letters, as
      well as sub and superscripts

   10) Support log scaling


-- Allow background color to be set for subplots  

-- Expose bug on win32 for axis text

-- Fix floating point bug on panx/pany where 0 is computed as 5e-17

-- fmt process  bug on this kind of plot command (2nd of 3 has no
   format string)

   plot(t1, p1, 'o', t2, p2, ogtt.times, ogtt.cpeptide, 's')

-- xlabel is lower than it needs to be
