Here's a list of things the remaining things I think need to be done
before publication quality (2D) is achieved (if you have suggested
additions to this list, email me)

   * Display fonts vertically (ylabel).  Arbitrary orientations would
      be nicer and would be matlab mimic the matlab handle rotation
      for text.

       UPDATE: vertical text support and ylabel added 2003-05-01

   * Arbitrary locs for axis text

      UPDATE: added the text command, which provides arbitrary axis
      text

   * Legend

   * Allow text to scale for high res prints 

   * Support multiple output resolutions and formats: 

      UPDATE: Added support for png and jpeg. 2003-05-01  Gdk-Pixbufs
      can support more types, but apparently pygtk only supports these
      2.  This may be GTK or pygtk build dependent.  

   * Fix the script time render time inconsitencies (like axis lim
      autoscalig which occurs at rendering and is not available during
      script

   * Allow interactive control of plot thru threading

      UPDATE: added examples/interactive.py which is an interactive
      prompt for making figures

   * Support a richer char set for labeling, eg greek letters, as
      well as sub and superscripts

   * Support log scaling
