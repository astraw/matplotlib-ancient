/*
 This file contains a number of vertex converters that modify
 paths. They all work as iterators, where the output is generated
 on-the-fly, and don't require a copy of the full data.

 Each class represents a discrete step in a "path-cleansing" pipeline.
 They are currently applied in the following order in the Agg backend:

   1. Affine transformation (implemented in Agg, not here)

   2. PathNanRemover: skips over segments containing non-finite numbers
      by inserting MOVETO commands

   3. PathClipper: Clips line segments to a given rectangle.  This is
      helpful for data reduction, and also to avoid a limitation in
      Agg where coordinates can not be larger than 24-bit signed
      integers.

   4. PathQuantizer: Rounds the path to the nearest center-pixels.
      This makes rectilinear curves look much better.

   5. PathSimplifier: Removes line segments from highly dense paths
      that would not have an impact on their appearance.  Speeds up
      rendering and reduces file sizes.

   6. curve-to-line-segment conversion (implemented in Agg, not here)

   7. stroking (implemented in Agg, not here)

           length, and we can combine sequential parallel lines into a
           single line instead of redrawing lines over the same
           points.  The loop below works a bit like a state machine,
           where what it does depends on what it did in the last
           looping. To test whether sequential lines are close to
           parallel, I calculate the distance moved perpendicular to
           the last line. Once it gets too big, the lines cannot be
           combined. */
