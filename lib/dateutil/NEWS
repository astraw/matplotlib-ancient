Version 1.2
-----------

- Now tzfile will round timezones to full-minutes if necessary,
  since Python's datetime doesn't support sub-minute offsets.
  Thanks to Ilpo Nyyssönen for reporting the issue.

- Removed bare string exceptions, as reported and fixed by
  Wilfredo Sánchez Vega.

- Fix bug in leap count parsing (reported and fixed by Eugene Oden).


Version 1.1
-----------

- Fixed rrule byyearday handling. Abramo Bagnara pointed out that
  RFC2445 allows negative numbers.

- Fixed --prefix handling in setup.py (by Sidnei da Silva).

- Now tz.gettz() returns a tzlocal instance when not given any
  arguments and no other timezone information is found.

- Updating timezone information to version 2005q.


Version 1.0
-----------

- Fixed parsing of XXhXXm formatted time after day/month/year
  has been parsed.

- Added patch by Jeffrey Harris optimizing rrule.__contains__.


Version 0.9
-----------

- Fixed pickling of timezone types, as reported by
  Andreas Köhler.

- Implemented internal timezone information with binary
  timezone files [1]. datautil.tz.gettz() function will now
  try to use the system timezone files, and fallback to
  the internal versions. It's also possible to ask for
  the internal versions directly by using
  dateutil.zoneinfo.gettz().

- New tzwin timezone type, allowing access to Windows
  internal timezones (contributed by Jeffrey Harris).

- Fixed parsing of unicode date strings.

- Accept parserinfo instances as the parser constructor
  parameter, besides parserinfo (sub)classes.

- Changed weekday to spell the not-set n value as None
  instead of 0.

- Fixed other reported bugs.

Version 0.5
-----------

- Removed FREQ_ prefix from rrule frequency constants
  WARNING: this breaks compatibility with previous versions.

- Fixed rrule.between() for cases where "after" is achieved
  before even starting, as reported by Andreas Köhler.

- Fixed two digit zero-year parsing (such as 31-Dec-00), as
  reported by Jim Abramson, and included test case for this.

- Sort exdate and rdate before iterating over them, so that
  it's not necessary to sort them before adding to the rruleset,
  as reported by Nicholas Piper.
