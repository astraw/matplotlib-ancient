# In order to efficiently plot many lines in a single set of axes,
# Matplotlib has the ability to add the lines all at once. Here is a
# simple example showing how it is done.

# Here are many sets of y to plot vs x
ys = [x+i for i in x]

# We need to set the plot limits, they will not autoscale

# colors is sequence of rgba tuples
# linestyle is a string or dash tuple. Legal string values are
#          solid|dashed|dashdot|dotted.  The dash tuple is (offset, onoffseq)
#          where onoffseq is an even length tuple of on and off ink in points.
#          If linestyle is omitted, 'solid' is used
# See matplotlib.collections.LineCollection for more information
