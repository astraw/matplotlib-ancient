You have a few different options available to you for embedding
matplotlib  in a wxPython application

1. Embed one of the wxPython backend widgets (which subclass wx.Panel)
   directly and draw plots on it using matplotlib's object-oriented
   API.  This approach is demonstrated by some of the examples
   embedding_in_wx*.py

2. Embed the PlotPanel from Matt Newville's `MPlot' package and draw
   plots on it using its plot() and oplot() methods.

3. Embed the PlotPanel from Ken McIvor wxmpl module and draw plots on
   it using the matplotlib's object-oriented API.

Each of these approachs has different benefits and drawbacks, so I
encourage you to evaluate each of them and select the one that best
meets your needs.
