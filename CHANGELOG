2005-11-30 Fixed out of bounds draw markers segfault in agg

2005-11-28 Got TkAgg blitting working 100% (cross fingers) correctly. - CM

2005-11-27 Multiple changes in cm.py, colors.py, figure.py, image.py,
           contour.py, contour_demo.py; new _cm.py, examples/image_masked.py.
           1) Separated the color table data from cm.py out into
           a new file, _cm.py, to make it easier to find the actual
           code in cm.py and to add new colormaps.  Also added
           some line breaks to the color data dictionaries. Everything
           from _cm.py is imported by cm.py, so the split should be
           transparent.
           2) Enabled automatic generation of a colormap from
           a list of colors in contour; see modified
           examples/contour_demo.py.
           3) Support for imshow of a masked array, with the
           ability to specify colors (or no color at all) for
           masked regions, and for regions that are above or
           below the normally mapped region.  See
           examples/image_masked.py.
           4) In support of the above, added two new classes,
           ListedColormap, and no_norm, to colors.py, and modified
           the Colormap class to include common functionality. Added
           a clip kwarg to the normalize class.  Reworked color
           handling in contour.py, especially in the ContourLabeller
           mixin.

2005-11-16 Added a maxdict item to cbook to prevent caches from
           growing w/o bounds

           added keyword arg (clip_ends) to contourf.
           Colorbar modified to work with new ContourSet object;
           if the ContourSet has lines rather than polygons, the
           colorbar will follow suit. Fixed a bug introduced in
           0.84, in which contourf(...,colors=...) was broken - EF

2005-07-06 Made HOME/.matplotlib the new config dir where the
           matplotlibrc file, the ttf.cache, and the tex.cache live.
           The new default filenames in .matplotlib have no leading
           dot and are not hidden.  Eg, the new names are matplotlibrc
           tex.cache ttffont.cache.  This is how ipython does it so it
           must be right.  If old files are found, a warning is issued
           and they are moved to the new location.  Also fixed
           texmanager to put all files, including temp files in
           ~/.matplotlib/tex.cache, which allows you to usetex in
           non-writable dirs.

2005-07-05 Fixed bug #1231611 in subplots adjust layout.  The problem
           was that the text cacheing mechanism was not using the
           transformation affine in the key. - JDH

2005-07-05 Fixed default backend import problem when using API (SF bug
           # 1209354 -  see API_CHANGES for more info - JDH

           and fills - JDH

2005-06-21 Moved some texmanager and backend_agg tex caching to class
           level rather than instance level - JDH

2005-06-18 Move Figure.get_width_height() to FigureCanvasBase and return
           int instead of float. - SC

2005-06-18 Applied Ted Drain's QtAgg patch: 1) Changed the toolbar to
           be a horizontal bar of push buttons instead of a QToolbar
           and updated the layout algorithms in the main window
           accordingly.  This eliminates the ability to drag and drop
           the toolbar and detach it from the window.  2) Updated the
           resize algorithm in the main window to show the correct
           size for the plot widget as requested.  This works almost
           correctly right now.  It looks to me like the final size of
           the widget is off by the border of the main window but I
           haven't figured out a way to get that information yet.  We
           could just add a small margin to the new size but that
           seems a little hacky.  3) Changed the x/y location label to
           be in the toolbar like the Tk backend instead of as a
           status line at the bottom of the widget.  4) Changed the
           toolbar pixmaps to use the ppm files instead of the png
           files.  I noticed that the Tk backend buttons looked much
           nicer and it uses the ppm files so I switched them.

2005-06-17 Modified the gtk backend to not queue mouse motion events.
           This allows for live updates when dragging a slider. - CM

2005-06-17 Added starter CocoaAgg backend.  Only works on OS 10.3 for
           now and requires PyObjC.  (10.4 is high priority) - CM

2005-06-17 Upgraded pyparsing and applied Paul McGuire's suggestions
           for speeding things up.  This more than doubles the speed
           of mathtext in my simple tests. JDH

2005-06-16 Applied David Cooke's subplot make_key patch

========================================================

2005-06-15 0.82 released

2005-06-15 Added subplot config tool to GTK* backends -- note you must
           now import the NavigationToolbar2 from your backend of
           choice rather than from backend_gtk because it needs to
           know about the backend specific canvas -- see
           examples/embedding_in_gtk2.py.  Ditto for wx backend -- see
           examples/embedding_in_wxagg.py

2005-06-15 backend_cairo.py: updated to use pycairo 0.5.0 - SC

2005-06-14 Wrote some GUI neutral widgets (Button, Slider,

           examples/widgets/*.py - JDH

2005-06-14 Exposed subplot parameters as rc vars and as the fig
           SubplotParams instance subplotpars.  See
           figure.SubplotParams, figure.Figure.subplots_adjust and the
           pylab method subplots_adjust and
           examples/subplots_adjust.py .  Also added a GUI neutral
           widget for adjusting subplots, see
           examples/subplot_toolbar.py - JDH

2005-06-13 Exposed cap and join style for lines with new rc params and
           line properties

	lines.dash_joinstyle : miter        # miter|round|bevel
	lines.dash_capstyle : butt          # butt|round|projecting
	lines.solid_joinstyle : miter       # miter|round|bevel
	lines.solid_capstyle : projecting   # butt|round|projecting

2005-06-05 Fixed a TeX/LaTeX font discrepency in backend_ps. - DSD

2005-06-05 Added a ps.distill option in rc settings. If True, postscript
           output will be distilled using ghostscript, which should trim
           the file size and allow it to load more quickly. Hopefully this
           will address the issue of large ps files due to font
           definitions. Tested with gnu-ghostscript-8.16. - DSD

2005-06-03 Improved support for tex handling of text in backend_ps. - DSD

2005-06-03 Added rc options to render text with tex or latex, and to select
           the latex font package. - DSD

2005-05-31 Added vertical TeX support for agg - JDH

2005-05-31 Applied Eric's cntr patch - JDH

2005-05-27 Finally found the pesky agg bug (which Maxim was kind
           enough to fix within hours) that was causing a segfault in
           the win32 cached marker drawing.  Now windows users can get
           the enormouse performance benefits of caced markers w/o
           those occasional pesy screenshots. - JDH

2005-05-27 Got win32 build system working again, using a more recent
           version of gtk and pygtk in the win32 build, gtk 2.6 from
           http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html (you
           will also need libpng12.dll to use these).  I haven't
           tested whether this binary build of mpl for win32 will work
           with older gtk runtimes, so you may need to upgrade.

2005-05-27 Fixed bug where 2nd wxapp could be started if using wxagg
           backend. - ADS

2005-05-26 Added Daishi text with dash patch -- see examples/dashtick.py

2005-05-26 Moved backend_latex functionality into backend_ps. If
           text.usetex=True, the PostScript backend will use LaTeX to
           generate the .ps or .eps file. Ghostscript is required for
           eps output. - DSD

2005-05-24 Fixed alignment and color issues in latex backend. - DSD

2005-05-21 Fixed raster problem for small rasters with dvipng -- looks
           like it was a premultipled alpha problem - JDH

2005-05-20 Added linewidth and faceted kwarg to scatter to control
           edgewidth and color.  Also added autolegend patch to
           inspect line segments.

2005-05-18 Added Orsay and JPL qt fixes - JDH

2005-05-17 Added a psfrag latex backend -- some alignment issues need
           to be worked out. Run with -dLaTeX and a *.tex file and
           *.eps file are generated.  latex and dvips the generated
           latex file to get ps output.  Note xdvi *does* not work,
           you must generate ps.- JDH

2005-05-12 Started work on TeX text for antigrain using pngdvi -- see
           examples/tex_demo.py and the new module
           matplotlib.texmanager.  Rotated text not supported and
           rendering small glyps is not working right yet.  BUt large
           fontsizes and/or high dpi saved figs work great.

2005-05-10 New image resize options interpolation options.  New values
           for the interp kwarg are

           'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic', 'spline16', 'spline36',
	   'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite', 'kaiser', 'quadric',
	   'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell', 'sinc',
	   'lanczos', 'blackman'

           See help(imshow) for details, particularly the
           interpolation, filternorm and filterrad kwargs


2005-05-10 Applied Eric's contour mem leak fixes - JDH

2005-05-10 Extended python agg wrapper and started implementing
           backend_agg2, an agg renderer based on the python wrapper.
           This will be more flexible and easier to extend than the
           current backend_agg.  See also examples/agg_test.py - JDH

2005-05-09 Added Marcin's no legend patch to exclude lines from the
           autolegend builder

           plot(x, y, label='nolegend')

           where keyboard input was grabbed by the figure and not
           released  2) turn on cursor changes  3) clean up a typo
           and commented-out print statement. - JDH


2005-04-14 Applied Eric Firing's masked data lines patch and contour
           patch.  Support for masked arrays has been added to the
           plot command and to the Line2D object.  Only the valid
           points are plotted.  A "valid_only" kwarg was added to the
           get_xdata() and get_ydata() methods of Line2D; by default
           it is False, so that the original data arrays are
           returned. Setting it to True returns the plottable points.
           - see examples/masked_demo.py - JDH

2005-04-13 Applied Tim Leslie's arrow key event handling patch - JDH


=================================================================
0.80 released

2005-04-11 Applied a variant of rick's xlim/ylim/axis patch.  These
           functions now take kwargs to let you selectively alter only
           the min or max if desired.  Eg xlim(xmin=2) or
           axis(ymax=3).  They always return the new lim. - JDH


2005-04-11 Incorporated Werner's wx patch -- wx backend should be
           compatible with wxpython2.4 and recent versions of 2.5.
           Some early versions of wxpython 2.5 will not work because
           there was a temporary change in the dc API that was rolled
           back to make it 2.4 compliant

2005-04-11 modified tkagg show so that new figure window pops up on
           call to figure

2005-04-11 fixed wxapp init bug

2005-03-28 Added Jarrod's svg patch for text - JDH

2005-03-28 Added Ludal's arrow and quiver patch - JDH

2005-03-28 Added label kwarg to Axes to facilitate forcing the
           creation of new Axes with otherwise identical attributes

2005-03-28 Applied boxplot and OSX font search patches

2005-03-27 Added ft2font NULL check to fix Japanase font bug - JDH

2005-03-27 Added sprint legend patch plus John Gill's tests and fix --
           see examples/legend_auto.py  - JDH

==========================================================================

2005-03-19 0.73.1 released

2005-03-19 Reverted wxapp handling because it crashed win32 - JDH

2005-03-18 Add .number attribute to figure objects returned by figure() - FP

2005-03-16 Applied Darren's ticker fix for small ranges - JDH

2005-03-16 Fixed tick on horiz colorbar - JDH

2005-03-16 Added Japanses winreg patch - JDH

2005-03-15 backend_gtkagg.py: changed to use double buffering, this fixes
           the problem reported Joachim Berdal Haga - "Parts of plot lagging
       from previous frame in animation". Tested with anim.py and it makes
           no noticable difference to performance (23.7 before, 23.6 after)
       - SC

2005-03-14 add src/_backend_gdk.c extension to provide a substitute function
       for pixbuf.get_pixels_array(). Currently pixbuf.get_pixels_array()
           only works with Numeric, and then only works if pygtk has been
       compiled with Numeric support. The change provides a function
       pixbuf_get_pixels_array() which works with Numeric and numarray and
       is always available. It means that backend_gtk should be able to
       display images and mathtext in all circumstances. - SC

2005-03-11 Upgraded CXX to 5.3.1

2005-03-10 remove GraphicsContextPS.set_linestyle()
       and GraphicsContextSVG.set_linestyle() since they do no more than
           the base class GraphicsContext.set_linestyle() - SC

2005-03-09 Refactored contour functionality into dedicated module

2005-03-09 Added Eric's contourf updates and Nadia's clabel functionality

2005-03-09 Moved colorbar to figure.Figure to expose it for API developers
          - JDH

2005-03-09 backend_cairo.py: implemented draw_markers() - SC

2005-03-09 cbook.py: only use enumerate() (the python version) if the builtin
       version is not available.
           Add new function 'izip' which is set to itertools.izip if available
           and the python equivalent if not available. - SC

2005-03-07 backend_gdk.py: remove PIXELS_PER_INCH from points_to_pixels(), but
       still use it to adjust font sizes. This allows the GTK version of
           line_styles.py to more closely match GTKAgg, previously the markers
           were being drawn too large. - SC

2005-03-01 Added Eric's contourf routines

2005-03-01 Added start of proper agg SWIG wrapper.  I would like to
           expose agg functionality directly a the user level and this
           module will serve that purpose eventually, and will
           hopefully take over most of the functionality of the
           current _image and _backend_agg modules.  - JDH

2005-02-28 Fixed polyfit / polyval to convert input args to float
           arrays - JDH


2005-02-25 Add experimental feature to backend_gtk.py to enable/disable
           double buffering (DBL_BUFFER=True/False) - SC

2005-02-24 colors.py change ColorConverter.to_rgb() so it always returns rgb
           (and not rgba), allow cnames keys to be cached, change the exception
           raised from RuntimeError to ValueError (like hex2color())
       hex2color() use a regular expression to check the color string is
           valid  - SC


2005-02-23 Added rc param ps.useafm so backend ps can use native afm
           fonts or truetype.  afme breaks mathtext but causes much
           smaller font sizes and may result in images that display
           better in some contexts (eg pdfs incorporated into latex
           docs viewed in acrobat reader).  I would like to extend
           this approach to allow the user to use truetype only for
           mathtext, which should be easy.

2005-02-23 Used sequence protocol rather than tuple in agg collection
           drawing routines for greater flexibility - JDH


===========================================================
2005-02-22 0.72.1 released

2005-02-21 fixed linestyles for collections -- contour now dashes for
           levels <0

2005-02-21 fixed ps color bug - JDH

2005-02-15 fixed missing qt file

2005-02-15 banished error_msg and report_error.  Internal backend
           methods like error_msg_gtk are preserved.  backend writers,
           check your backends, and diff against 0.72 to make sure I
           did the right thing! - JDH

2005-02-08 Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando
           Perez (FP from now on).

2005-02-08 Small optimizations in PS backend.  They may have a big impact for
           large plots, otherwise they don't hurt  - FP

2005-02-08 Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando
           Perez (FP from now on).

           backend:TkAgg

2005-01-28 Replaced examples/interactive.py with an updated script from
           Fernando Perez - SC

           region=1 seems t fix a lot of the zigzag strangeness.
           Added colormaps as default for contour - JDH

2005-01-19 Restored builtin names which were overridden (min, max,
           abs, round, and sum) in pylab.  This is a potentially
           significant change for those who were relying on an array
           version of those functions that previously overrode builtin
           function names. - ADS

2005-01-18 Added accents to mathtext: \hat, \breve, \grave, \bar,
           \acute, \tilde, \vec, \dot, \ddot.  All of them have the
           same syntax, eg to make an overbar you do \bar{o} or to
           make an o umlaut you do \ddot{o}. The shortcuts are also
           provided, eg: \"o \'e \`e \~n \.x \^y - JDH

2005-01-18 Plugged image resize memory leaks - JDH

2005-01-18 Fixed some mathtext parser problems relating to superscripts

           approx 800k to approx 6k- JDH

2005-01-17 Added kappa to latex_to_bakoma - JDH

2005-01-15 Support arbitrary colorbar axes and horizontal colorbars - JDH

       matures - SC

2005-01-15 Added Nadia's x,y contour fix

2005-01-12 Fixed set clip_on bug in artist - JDH

2005-01-09 Fixed a backend_bases event bug caused when an event is
           triggered when location is None - JDH

2005-01-07 Add patch from Stephen Walton to fix bug in pylab.load()
           when the % character is included in a comment. - ADS

           the marker size in the legend to be adjusted relative to
           that in the plot. - ADS

2005-01-06 Add patch from Ben Vanhaeren to make the FigureManagerGTK vbox a
           public attribute - SC

====================================================================
2004-12-30 Release 0.70

2004-12-28 Added coord location to key press and added a
           examples/picker_demo.py

2004-12-28 Fixed coords notification in wx toolbar - JDH

2004-12-28 Moved connection and disconnection event handling to the
           FigureCanvasBase.  Backends now only need to connect one
           time for each of the button press, button release and key
           press/release functions.  The base class deals with
           callbacks and multiple connections.  This fixes flakiness
           on some backends (tk, wx) in the presence of multiple
           connections and/or disconnect - JDH

2004-12-27 Fixed PS mathtext bug where color was not set - Jochen
           please verify correct - JDH

2004-12-27 Added Shadow class and added shadow kwarg to legend and pie
           for shadow effect - JDH

2004-12-27 Added pie charts and new example/pie_demo.py

2004-12-23 Fixed an agg text rotation alignment bug, fixed some text
           kwarg processing bugs, and added examples/text_rotation.py
           to explain and demonstrate how text rotations and alignment
           work in matplotlib. - JDH

======================================================================

2004-12-22 0.65.1 released - JDH

2004-12-22 Fixed colorbar bug which caused colorbar not to respond to
           changes in colormap in some instances - JDH

2004-12-22 Refactored NavigationToolbar in tkagg to support app
           embedding , init now takes (canvas, window) rather than
           (canvas, figman) - JDH

2004-12-21 Refactored axes and subplot management - removed
           add_subplot and add_axes from the FigureManager.  classic
           toolbar updates are done via an observer pattern on the
           figure using add_axobserver.  Figure now maintains the axes
           stack (for gca) and supports axes deletion.  Ported changes
           to GTK, Tk, Wx, and FLTK.  Please test!  Added delaxes - JDH

2004-12-21 Lots of image optimizations - 4x performance boost over
           0.65 JDH

2004-12-20 Fixed a figimage bug where the axes is shown and modified
           tkagg to move the destroy binding into the show method.

2004-12-18 Minor refactoring of NavigationToolbar2 to support
           embedding in an application - JDH

2004-12-14 Added linestyle to collections (currently broken) -  JDH

2004-12-14 Applied Nadia's setupext patch to fix libstdc++ link
           problem with contour and solaris  -JDH

2004-12-14 A number of pychecker inspired fixes, including removal of
           True and False from cbook which I erroneously thought was
           needed for python2.2 - JDH

2004-12-14 Finished porting doc strings for set introspection.
           Used silent_list for many get funcs that return
           lists. JDH

2004-12-13 dates.py: removed all timezone() calls, except for UTC - SC

======================================================================

2004-12-13 0.65 released - JDH

2004-12-13 colors.py: rgb2hex(), hex2color() made simpler (and faster), also
           rgb2hex() - added round() instead of integer truncation
           hex2color() - changed 256.0 divisor to 255.0, so now
           '#ffffff' becomes (1.0,1.0,1.0) not (0.996,0.996,0.996) - SC

2004-12-11 Added ion and ioff to pylab interface - JDH

2004-12-11 backend_template.py: delete FigureCanvasTemplate.realize() - most
           backends don't use it and its no longer needed

           backend_ps.py, backend_svg.py: delete show() and
           draw_if_interactive() - they are not needed for image backends

           backend_svg.py: write direct to file instead of StringIO
           - SC

2004-12-10 Added zorder to artists to control drawing order of lines,
           patches and text in axes.  See examples/zoder_demo.py - JDH

2004-12-09 Added Matthew Newville's wx printing patch

2004-12-09 Migrated matlab to pylab - JDH

2004-12-09 backend_gtk.py: split into two parts
           - backend_gdk.py - an image backend
           - backend_gtk.py - A GUI backend that uses GDK - SC

2004-12-08 backend_gtk.py: remove quit_after_print_xvfb(*args), show_xvfb(),
       Dialog_MeasureTool(gtk.Dialog) one month after sending mail to
           matplotlib-users asking if anyone still uses these functions - SC

2004-12-02 backend_bases.py, backend_template.py: updated some of the method
           documentation to make them consistent with each other - SC

2004-12-04 Fixed multiple bindings per event for TkAgg mpl_connect and
    mpl_disconnect.  Added a "test_disconnect" command line
    parameter to coords_demo.py  JTM

2004-12-04 Fixed some legend bugs JDH

2004-11-30 Added over command for oneoff over plots.  Eg over(plot, x,
           y, lw=2).  Works with any plot function.

2004-11-30 Added bbox property to text - JDH

2004-11-29 Zoom to rect now respect reversed axes limits (for both
           linear and log axes). - GL

2004-11-29 Added the over command to the matlab interface.  over
           allows you to add an overlay plot regardless of hold
       state. - JDH

2004-11-25 Added Printf to mplutils for printf style format string
           formatting in C++ (should help write better exceptions)

2004-11-24 IMAGE_FORMAT: remove from agg and gtkagg backends as its no longer
           used - SC

2004-11-23 backend_gtk.py: added a default exception handler - SC

2004-11-18 backend_gtk.py: change so that the backend knows about all image
           formats and does not need to use IMAGE_FORMAT in other backends - SC

2004-11-18 Fixed some report_error bugs in string interpolation as
           reported on SF bug tracker- JDH

2004-11-17 backend_gtkcairo.py: change so all print_figure() calls render using
           Cairo and get saved using backend_gtk.print_figure() - SC

2004-11-13 backend_cairo.py: Discovered the magic number (96) required for
       Cairo PS plots to come out the right size. Restored Cairo PS output
       and added support for landscape mode - SC

2004-11-13 Added ishold - JDH

2004-11-12 Added many new matlab colormaps - autumn bone cool copper
      flag gray hot hsv jet pink prism spring summer winter - PG

2004-11-11 greatly simplify the emitted postscript code - JV

2004-11-12 Added new plotting functions spy, spy2 for sparse matrix
           visualization - JDH

           locations and labels for polar plots - JDH

2004-11-11 make the Gtk backends build without an X-server connection - JV

2004-11-10 matplotlib/__init__.py: Added FROZEN to signal we are running under
           py2exe (or similar) - is used by backend_gtk.py - SC

2004-11-09 backend_gtk.py: Made fix suggested by maffew@cat.org.au
       to prevent problems when py2exe calls pygtk.require(). - SC

2004-11-09 backend_cairo.py: Added support for printing to a fileobject.
           Disabled cairo PS output which is not working correctly. - SC

==============================================================
2004-11-08 matplotlib-0.64 released

2004-11-04 Changed -dbackend processing to only use known backends, so
           we don't clobber other non-matplotlib uses of -d, like -debug.

2004-11-04 backend_agg.py: added IMAGE_FORMAT to list the formats that the
           backend can save to.
           backend_gtkagg.py: added support for saving JPG files by using the
           GTK backend - SC

2004-10-31 backend_cairo.py: now produces png and ps files (although the figure
           sizing needs some work). pycairo did not wrap all the necessary
           functions, so I wrapped them myself, they are included in the
           backend_cairo.py doc string. - SC

2004-10-31 backend_ps.py: clean up the generated PostScript code, use
           the PostScript stack to hold itermediate values instead of
           storing them in the dictionary. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_ps.py, ft2font.cpp, ft2font.h: fix the position of
           text in the PostScript output.  The new FT2Font method
           get_descent gives the distance between the lower edge of
           the bounding box and the baseline of a string.  In
           backend_ps the text is shifted upwards by this amount. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_ps.py: clean up the code a lot.  Change the
           PostScript output to be more DSC compliant.  All
           definitions for the generated PostScript are now in a

           dependency on widget events - SC

2004-10-28 backend_cairo.py: The renderer is complete except for mathtext,
           draw_image() and clipping. gtkcairo works reasonably well. cairo
           does not yet create any files since I can't figure how to set the
           'target surface', I don't think pycairo wraps the required functions
       - SC

2004-10-28 backend_gtk.py: Improved the save dialog (GTK 2.4 only) so it
           presents the user with a menu of supported image formats - SC

           required upgrade to agg22 which fixed an agg bug related to
           this problem

2004-09-20 Added toolbar2 message display for backend_tkagg.  JTM


2004-09-17 Added coords formatter attributes.  These must be callable,
           and return a string for the x or y data. These will be used
           to format the x and y data for the coords box.  Default is
           the axis major formatter.  Eg

         # format the coords message box
         def price(x): return '$%1.2f'%x
         ax.format_xdata = DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d')
         ax.format_ydata = price


2004-09-17 Total rewrite of dates handling to use python datetime with
           num2date, date2num and drange.  pytz for timezone handling,
           dateutils for spohisticated ticking.  date ranges from
           0001-9999 are supported.  rrules allow arbitrary date
           ticking.  examples/date_demo*.py converted to show new
           usage.  new example examples/date_demo_rrule.py shows how
           to use rrules in date plots.  The date locators are much
           more general and almost all of them have different
           constructors.  See matplotlib.dates for more info.

2004-09-15 Applied Fernando's backend __init__ patch to support easier
           backend maintenance.  Added his numutils to mlab.  JDH

2004-09-16 Re-designated all files in matplotlib/images as binary and
       w/o keyword substitution using "cvs admin -kb *.svg ...".
       See binary files in "info cvs" under Linux.  This was messing
       up builds from CVS on windows since CVS was doing lf -> cr/lf
       and keyword substitution on the bitmaps.  - JTM

2004-09-15 Modified setup to build array-package-specific extensions
       for those extensions which are array-aware.  Setup builds
       extensions automatically for either Numeric, numarray, or
       both, depending on what you have installed.  Python proxy
       modules for the array-aware extensions import the version
       optimized for numarray or Numeric determined by numerix.
           - JTM

2004-09-15 Moved definitions of infinity from mlab to numerix to avoid
       divide by zero warnings for numarray - JTM

           - Fixed y zoom tool bug

           - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem.
             The problem was that for solid lines, the y data clipping
             (as opposed to the gc clipping) caused artifactual
             horizontal solid lines near the ylim boundaries.  I did a
             5% offset hack in Axes set_ylim functions which helped,
             but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms.
             So I disabled y data clipping for connected lines .  If
             you need extensive y clipping, either plot(y,x) because x
             data clipping is always enabled, or change the _set_clip
             code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src.  See
             _set_clip in lines.py and set_ylim in figure.py for more
             information.


2002-12-11 - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to
             measure axes position and the delta x delta y with a left
             mouse drag.  These defaults can be overridden by deriving
             from Figure and overrriding button_press_event,
             button_release_event, and motion_notify_event,
             and _dialog_measure_tool.

           - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the
             navigation buttons apply to.



2003-04-23 Released matplotlib v0.1

2003-04-24 Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the
           markers as pixels (as small as possible) with format
           symbol ','

           Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle,
           RegularPolygon and Circle

2003-04-25 Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist

           Added a new line type '|' which is a vline.  syntax is
       plot(x, Y, '|') where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives
       the ymin,ymax for the respective values of x.  Previously I
       had implemented vlines as a list of lines, but I needed the
       efficientcy of the numeric clipping for large numbers of
       vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class
       Vline2D which derives from Line2D


2003-05-01

   Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip

2003-05-14

   Added new ways to specify colors 1) matlab format string 2)
   html-style hex string, 3) rgb tuple.  See examples/color_demo.py

2003-05-28

    Changed figure rendering to draw form a pixmap to reduce flicker.
    See examples/system_monitor.py for an example where the plot is
    continusouly updated w/o flicker.  This example is meant to
    simulate a system monitor that shows free CPU, RAM, etc...

2003-08-04

    Added Jon Anderson's GTK shell, which doesn't require pygtk to
    have threading built-in and looks nice!

2003-08-25

   Fixed deprecation warnings for python2.3 and pygtk-1.99.18

2003-08-26

   Added figure text with new example examples/figtext.py


2003-08-27

   Fixed bugs i figure text with font override dictionairies and fig
   text that was placed outside the window bounding box

2003-09-1 thru 2003-09-15

   Added a postscript and a GD module backend

2003-09-16

   Fixed font scaling and point scaling so circles, squares, etc on
   lines will scale with DPI as will fonts.  Font scaling is not fully
   implemented on the gtk backend because I have not figured out how
   to scale fonts to arbitrary sizes with GTK

2003-09-17

   Fixed figure text bug which crashed X windows on long figure text
   extending beyond display area.  This was, I believe, due to the
   vestigial erase functionality that was no longer needed since I
   began rendering to a pixmap

2003-09-30  Added legend

2003-10-01 Fixed bug when colors are specified with rgb tuple or hex
   string.


2003-10-21  Andrew Straw provided some legend code which I modified
      and incorporated.  Thanks Andrew!

2003-10-27 Fixed a bug in axis.get_view_distance that affected zoom in
  versus out with interactive scrolling, and a bug in the axis text
  reset system that prevented the text from being redrawn on a
  interactive gtk view lim set with the widget

  Fixed a bug in that prevented the manual setting of ticklabel
  strings from working properly

2003-11-02 - Do a nearest neighbor color pick on GD when
             allocate fails

2003-11-02
   - Added pcolor plot
   - Added MRI example
   - Fixed bug that screwed up label position if xticks or yticks were
     empty
   - added nearest neighbor color picker when GD max colors exceeded
   - fixed figure background color bug in GD backend

2003-11-10 - 2003-11-11
   - major refactoring.
     * Ticks (with labels, lines and grid) handled by dedicated class
     * Artist now know bounding box and dpi
     * Bounding boxes and transforms handled by dedicated classes
     * legend in dedicated class.  Does a better job of alignment and
       bordering.  Can be initialized with specific line instances.
       See examples/legend_demo2.py


2003-11-14 Fixed legend positioning bug and added new position args

2003-11-16 Finsihed porting GD to new axes API


2003-11-20 - add TM for matlab on website and in docs


2003-11-20 - make a nice errorbar and scatter screenshot

2003-11-20 - auto line style cycling for multiple line types
   broken

2003-11-18 (using inkrect) :logical rect too big on gtk backend

2003-11-18 ticks don't reach edge of axes in gtk mode --
   rounding error?

2003-11-20 - port Gary's errorbar code to new API before 0.40

2003-11-20 - problem with stale _set_font.  legend axes box
   doesn't resize on save in GTK backend -- see htdocs legend_demo.py

2003-11-21 - make a dash-dot dict for the GC

2003-12-15 - fix install path bug
