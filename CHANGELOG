2002-12-10 - Added a TODO file and CHANGELOG.  Lots to do -- get
             crackin'!

           - Fixed y zoom tool bug

           - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem.
             The problem was that for solid lines, the y data clipping
             (as opposed to the gc clipping) caused artifactual
             horizontal solid lines near the ylim boundaries.  I did a
             5% offset hack in Axes set_ylim functions which helped,
             but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms.
             So I disabled y data clipping for connected lines .  If
             you need extensive y clipping, either plot(y,x) because x
             data clipping is always enabled, or change the _set_clip
             code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src.  See
             _set_clip in lines.py and set_ylim in figure.py for more
             information.


2002-12-11 - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to
             measure axes position and the delta x delta y with a left
             mouse drag.  These defaults can be overridden by deriving
             from Figure and overrriding button_press_event,
             button_release_event, and motion_notify_event,
             and _dialog_measure_tool.

           - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the
             navigation buttons apply to.



2003-04-23 Released matplotlib v0.1

2003-04-24 Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the
           markers as pixels (as small as possible) with format
           symbol ','
 
           Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle,
           RegularPolygon and Circle

2003-04-25 Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist
 
           Added a new line type '|' which is a vline.  syntax is 
	   plot(x, Y, '|') where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives
	   the ymin,ymax for the respective values of x.  Previously I
	   had implemented vlines as a list of lines, but I needed the
	   efficientcy of the numeric clipping for large numbers of
	   vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class
	   Vline2D which derives from Line2D


            
2003-05-01
   
   Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip
