--------------------------------------------
This is the Old, stale, never used changelog

2002-12-10 - Added a TODO file and CHANGELOG.  Lots to do -- get
             crackin'!

           - Fixed y zoom tool bug

           - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem.
             The problem was that for solid lines, the y data clipping
             (as opposed to the gc clipping) caused artifactual
             horizontal solid lines near the ylim boundaries.  I did a
             5% offset hack in Axes set_ylim functions which helped,
             but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms.
             So I disabled y data clipping for connected lines .  If
             you need extensive y clipping, either plot(y,x) because x
             data clipping is always enabled, or change the _set_clip
             code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src.  See
             _set_clip in lines.py and set_ylim in figure.py for more
             information.


2002-12-11 - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to
             measure axes position and the delta x delta y with a left
             mouse drag.  These defaults can be overridden by deriving
             from Figure and overrriding button_press_event,
             button_release_event, and motion_notify_event,
             and _dialog_measure_tool.

           - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the
             navigation buttons apply to.



2003-04-23 Released matplotlib v0.1

2003-04-24 Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the
           markers as pixels (as small as possible) with format
           symbol ','
 
           Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle,
           RegularPolygon and Circle

2003-04-25 Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist
 
           Added a new line type '|' which is a vline.  syntax is 
	   plot(x, Y, '|') where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives
	   the ymin,ymax for the respective values of x.  Previously I
	   had implemented vlines as a list of lines, but I needed the
	   efficientcy of the numeric clipping for large numbers of
	   vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class
	   Vline2D which derives from Line2D

            
2003-05-01
   
   Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip

2003-05-14
 
   Added new ways to specify colors 1) matlab format string 2)
   html-style hex string, 3) rgb tuple.  See examples/color_demo.py

2003-05-28

    Changed figure rendering to draw form a pixmap to reduce flicker.
    See examples/system_monitor.py for an example where the plot is
    continusouly updated w/o flicker.  This example is meant to
    simulate a system monitor that shows free CPU, RAM, etc...
	
2003-08-04

    Added Jon Anderson's GTK shell, which doesn't require pygtk to
    have threading built-in and looks nice!

2003-08-25
   
   Fixed deprecation warnings for python2.3 and pygtk-1.99.18

2003-08-26

   Added figure text with new example examples/figtext.py


2003-08-27
  
   Fixed bugs i figure text with font override dictionairies and fig
   text that was placed outside the window bounding box

2003-09-1 thru 2003-09-15  

   Added a postscript and a GD module backend

2003-09-16

   Fixed font scaling and point scaling so circles, squares, etc on
   lines will scale with DPI as will fonts.  Font scaling is not fully
   implemented on the gtk backend because I have not figured out how
   to scale fonts to arbitrary sizes with GTK

2003-09-17 
 
   Fixed figure text bug which crashed X windows on long figure text
   extending beyond display area.  This was, I believe, due to the
   vestigial erase functionality that was no longer needed since I
   began rendering to a pixmap

2003-09-30  Added legend

2003-10-01 Fixed bug when colors are specified with rgb tuple or hex
   string.


2003-10-21  Andrew Straw provided some legend code which I modified
      and incorporated.  Thanks Andrew!

2003-10-27 Fixed a bug in axis.get_view_distance that affected zoom in
  versus out with interactive scrolling, and a bug in the axis text
  reset system that prevented the text from being redrawn on a
  interactive gtk view lim set with the widget
 
  Fixed a bug in that prevented the manual setting of ticklabel
  strings from working properly

2003-11-02 - Do a nearest neighbor color pick on GD when
             allocate fails

2003-11-02 
   - Added pcolor plot
   - Added MRI example
   - Fixed bug that screwed up label position if xticks or yticks were
     empty
   - added nearest neighbor color picker when GD max colors exceeded
   - fixed figure background color bug in GD backend

2003-11-10 - 2003-11-11
   - major refactoring.  
     * Ticks (with labels, lines and grid) handled by dedicated class
     * Artist now know bounding box and dpi
     * Bounding boxes and transforms handled by dedicated classes
     * legend in dedicated class.  Does a better job of alignment and
       bordering.  Can be initialized with specific line instances.
       See examples/legend_demo2.py
 

2003-11-14 Fixed legend positioning bug and added new position args

2003-11-16 Finsihed porting GD to new axes API


2003-11-20 - add TM for matlab on website and in docs


2003-11-20 - make a nice errorbar and scatter screenshot   

2003-11-20 - auto line style cycling for multiple line types
   broken

2003-11-18 (using inkrect) :logical rect too big on gtk backend

2003-11-18 ticks don't reach edge of axes in gtk mode --
   rounding error?

2003-11-20 - port Gary's errorbar code to new API before 0.40

2003-11-20 - problem with stale _set_font.  legend axes box
   doesn't resize on save in GTK backend -- see htdocs legend_demo.py

2003-11-21 - make a dash-dot dict for the GC

2003-12-15 - fix install path bug
