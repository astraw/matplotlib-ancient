2005-03-09 Refactored contour functionality into dedicated module

2005-03-09 Added Eric's contourf updates and Nadia's clabel functionality
           - TODO, factor clabel into a dedicated class

2005-03-09 Moved colorbar to figure.Figure to expose it for API developers
          - JDH

2005-03-09 backend_cairo.py: implemented draw_markers() - SC

2005-03-09 cbook.py: only use enumerate() (the python version) if the builtin
	   version is not available.
           Add new function 'izip' which is set to itertools.izip if available
           and the python equivalent if not available. - SC

2005-03-07 backend_gdk.py: remove PIXELS_PER_INCH from points_to_pixels(), but
	   still use it to adjust font sizes. This allows the GTK version of
           line_styles.py to more closely match GTKAgg, previously the markers
           were being drawn too large. - SC

2005-03-01 Added Eric's contourf routines

2005-03-01 Added start of proper agg SWIG wrapper.  I would like to
           expose agg functionality directly a the user level and this
           module will serve that purpose eventually, and will
           hopefully take over most of the functionality of the
           current _image and _backend_agg modules.  - JDH

2005-02-28 Fixed polyfit / polyval to convert input args to float
           arrays - JDH


2005-02-25 Add experimental feature to backend_gtk.py to enable/disable
           double buffering (DBL_BUFFER=True/False) - SC

2005-02-24 colors.py change ColorConverter.to_rgb() so it always returns rgb 
           (and not rgba), allow cnames keys to be cached, change the exception
           raised from RuntimeError to ValueError (like hex2color())
	   hex2color() use a regular expression to check the color string is
           valid  - SC


2005-02-23 Added rc param ps.useafm so backend ps can use native afm
           fonts or truetype.  afme breaks mathtext but causes much
           smaller font sizes and may result in images that display
           better in some contexts (eg pdfs incorporated into latex
           docs viewed in acrobat reader).  I would like to extend
           this approach to allow the user to use truetype only for
           mathtext, which should be easy.

2005-02-23 Used sequence protocol rather than tuple in agg collection
           drawing routines for greater flexibility - JDH


===========================================================

2005-02-21 fixed ps color bug - JDH

2005-02-15 fixed missing qt file

2005-02-15 banished error_msg and report_error.  Internal backend
           methods like error_msg_gtk are preserved.  backend writers,
           check your backends, and diff against 0.72 to make sure I
           did the right thing! - JDH

2005-02-08 Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando
           Perez (FP from now on).

2005-02-08 Small optimizations in PS backend.  They may have a big impact for
           large plots, otherwise they don't hurt  - FP

2005-02-08 Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando
           Perez (FP from now on).

           compatible syntax; this also fixed an unequal sized contour
           array bug- JDH

2005-02-04 Modified GTK backends to allow the FigureCanvas to be resized

           backend:TkAgg

2005-01-28 Replaced examples/interactive.py with an updated script from
           Fernando Perez - SC

2005-01-27 Added support for shared x or y axes.  See
           examples/shared_axis_demo.py and examples/ganged_plots.py

2005-01-27 Added Lee's patch for missing symbols \leq and \LEFTbracket
           to _mathtext_data - JDH

           pylab interface for more info.  See also
           examples/two_scales.py

2005-01-24 Fixed a mathtext parser bug that prevented font changes in
           sub/superscripts - JDH

2005-01-24 Fixed contour to work w/ interactive changes in colormaps,
           clim, etc - JDH

           Added colormaps as default for contour - JDH

2005-01-19 Restored builtin names which were overridden (min, max,
           abs, round, and sum) in pylab.  This is a potentially
           significant change for those who were relying on an array
           version of those functions that previously overrode builtin
           function names. - ADS

2005-01-18 Added accents to mathtext: \hat, \breve, \grave, \bar,
           \acute, \tilde, \vec, \dot, \ddot.  All of them have the
           same syntax, eg to make an overbar you do \bar{o} or to
           make an o umlaut you do \ddot{o}. The shortcuts are also
           provided, eg: \"o \'e \`e \~n \.x \^y - JDH

2005-01-18 Plugged image resize memory leaks - JDH

2005-01-18 Fixed some mathtext parser problems relating to superscripts

	   matures - SC

2005-01-15 Added Nadia's x,y contour fix

2005-01-12 Fixed set clip_on bug in artist - JDH

2005-01-11 Reverted pythoninspect in tkagg - JDH

2005-01-09 Fixed a backend_bases event bug caused when an event is
           triggered when location is None - JDH

2005-01-07 Add patch from Stephen Walton to fix bug in pylab.load()
           when the % character is included in a comment. - ADS

           the marker size in the legend to be adjusted relative to
           that in the plot. - ADS

2005-01-06 Add patch from Ben Vanhaeren to make the FigureManagerGTK vbox a
           public attribute - SC

====================================================================
2004-12-30 Release 0.70

2004-12-28 Added coord location to key press and added a
           examples/picker_demo.py

2004-12-28 Fixed coords notification in wx toolbar - JDH

2004-12-28 Moved connection and disconnection event handling to the
           FigureCanvasBase.  Backends now only need to connect one
           time for each of the button press, button release and key
           press/release functions.  The base class deals with
           callbacks and multiple connections.  This fixes flakiness
           on some backends (tk, wx) in the presence of multiple
           connections and/or disconnect - JDH

2004-12-27 Fixed PS mathtext bug where color was not set - Jochen
           please verify correct - JDH

2004-12-27 Added Shadow class and added shadow kwarg to legend and pie
           for shadow effect - JDH

2004-12-23 Fixed an agg text rotation alignment bug, fixed some text
           kwarg processing bugs, and added examples/text_rotation.py
           to explain and demonstrate how text rotations and alignment
           work in matplotlib. - JDH

======================================================================

2004-12-22 0.65.1 released - JDH

2004-12-22 Fixed colorbar bug which caused colorbar not to respond to
           changes in colormap in some instances - JDH

2004-12-22 Refactored NavigationToolbar in tkagg to support app
           embedding , init now takes (canvas, window) rather than
           (canvas, figman) - JDH

2004-12-21 Refactored axes and subplot management - removed
           add_subplot and add_axes from the FigureManager.  classic
           toolbar updates are done via an observer pattern on the
           figure using add_axobserver.  Figure now maintains the axes
           stack (for gca) and supports axes deletion.  Ported changes
           to GTK, Tk, Wx, and FLTK.  Please test!  Added delaxes - JDH

2004-12-21 Lots of image optimizations - 4x performance boost over
           0.65 JDH

2004-12-20 Fixed a figimage bug where the axes is shown and modified
           tkagg to move the destroy binding into the show method.

2004-12-18 Minor refactoring of NavigationToolbar2 to support
           embedding in an application - JDH

2004-12-14 Added linestyle to collections (currently broken) -  JDH

2004-12-14 Applied Nadia's setupext patch to fix libstdc++ link
           problem with contour and solaris  -JDH

2004-12-14 A number of pychecker inspired fixes, including removal of
           True and False from cbook which I erroneously thought was
           needed for python2.2 - JDH

2004-12-14 Finished porting doc strings for set introspection.
           Used silent_list for many get funcs that return
           lists. JDH

2004-12-13 dates.py: removed all timezone() calls, except for UTC - SC

======================================================================

2004-12-13 0.65 released - JDH

2004-12-13 colors.py: rgb2hex(), hex2color() made simpler (and faster), also
           rgb2hex() - added round() instead of integer truncation
           hex2color() - changed 256.0 divisor to 255.0, so now
           '#ffffff' becomes (1.0,1.0,1.0) not (0.996,0.996,0.996) - SC

2004-12-11 Added ion and ioff to pylab interface - JDH

2004-12-11 backend_template.py: delete FigureCanvasTemplate.realize() - most
           backends don't use it and its no longer needed

           backend_ps.py, backend_svg.py: delete show() and 
           draw_if_interactive() - they are not needed for image backends

           backend_svg.py: write direct to file instead of StringIO
           - SC

2004-12-10 Added zorder to artists to control drawing order of lines,
           patches and text in axes.  See examples/zoder_demo.py - JDH

2004-12-10 Fixed colorbar bug with scatter - JDH

2004-12-10 Added Nadia Dencheva <dencheva@stsci.edu> contour code - JDH

2004-12-10 backend_cairo.py: got mathtext working - SC

2004-12-09 Added Norm Peterson's svg clipping patch

2004-12-09 Added Matthew Newville's wx printing patch

2004-12-09 Migrated matlab to pylab - JDH

2004-12-09 backend_gtk.py: split into two parts 
           - backend_gdk.py - an image backend
           - backend_gtk.py - A GUI backend that uses GDK - SC

2004-12-08 backend_gtk.py: remove quit_after_print_xvfb(*args), show_xvfb(), 
	   Dialog_MeasureTool(gtk.Dialog) one month after sending mail to
           matplotlib-users asking if anyone still uses these functions - SC

2004-12-02 backend_bases.py, backend_template.py: updated some of the method
           documentation to make them consistent with each other - SC

2004-12-04 Fixed multiple bindings per event for TkAgg mpl_connect and
	mpl_disconnect.  Added a "test_disconnect" command line 
	parameter to coords_demo.py  JTM

2004-12-04 Fixed some legend bugs JDH

2004-11-30 Added over command for oneoff over plots.  Eg over(plot, x,
           y, lw=2).  Works with any plot function.
 
2004-11-30 Added bbox property to text - JDH

2004-11-29 Zoom to rect now respect reversed axes limits (for both 
           linear and log axes). - GL
           
2004-11-29 Added the over command to the matlab interface.  over
           allows you to add an overlay plot regardless of hold
	   state. - JDH

2004-11-25 Added Printf to mplutils for printf style format string
           formatting in C++ (should help write better exceptions)

2004-11-24 IMAGE_FORMAT: remove from agg and gtkagg backends as its no longer
           used - SC

2004-11-23 Added matplotlib compatible set and get introspection.  See
           set_and_get.py

           to kwargs - JDH

2004-11-23 backend_gtk.py: added a default exception handler - SC

2004-11-18 backend_gtk.py: change so that the backend knows about all image
           formats and does not need to use IMAGE_FORMAT in other backends - SC

2004-11-18 Fixed some report_error bugs in string interpolation as
           reported on SF bug tracker- JDH
 
2004-11-17 backend_gtkcairo.py: change so all print_figure() calls render using
           Cairo and get saved using backend_gtk.print_figure() - SC

2004-11-13 backend_cairo.py: Discovered the magic number (96) required for
	   Cairo PS plots to come out the right size. Restored Cairo PS output
	   and added support for landscape mode	- SC

2004-11-13 Added ishold - JDH

2004-11-12 Added many new matlab colormaps - autumn bone cool copper
      flag gray hot hsv jet pink prism spring summer winter - PG

2004-11-11 greatly simplify the emitted postscript code - JV

2004-11-12 Added new plotting functions spy, spy2 for sparse matrix
           visualization - JDH

2004-11-11 Added rgrids, thetragrids for customizing the grid
           locations and labels for polar plots - JDH

2004-11-11 make the Gtk backends build without an X-server connection - JV

2004-11-10 matplotlib/__init__.py: Added FROZEN to signal we are running under
           py2exe (or similar) - is used by backend_gtk.py - SC

2004-11-09 backend_gtk.py: Made fix suggested by maffew@cat.org.au
	   to prevent problems when py2exe calls pygtk.require(). - SC

2004-11-09 backend_cairo.py: Added support for printing to a fileobject.
           Disabled cairo PS output which is not working correctly. - SC

==============================================================
2004-11-08 matplotlib-0.64 released

2004-11-04 Changed -dbackend processing to only use known backends, so
           we don't clobber other non-matplotlib uses of -d, like -debug.

2004-11-04 backend_agg.py: added IMAGE_FORMAT to list the formats that the 
           backend can save to.
           backend_gtkagg.py: added support for saving JPG files by using the
           GTK backend - SC

2004-10-31 backend_cairo.py: now produces png and ps files (although the figure
           sizing needs some work). pycairo did not wrap all the necessary 
           functions, so I wrapped them myself, they are included in the 
           backend_cairo.py doc string. - SC

2004-10-31 backend_ps.py: clean up the generated PostScript code, use
           the PostScript stack to hold itermediate values instead of
           storing them in the dictionary. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_ps.py, ft2font.cpp, ft2font.h: fix the position of
           text in the PostScript output.  The new FT2Font method
           get_descent gives the distance between the lower edge of
           the bounding box and the baseline of a string.  In
           backend_ps the text is shifted upwards by this amount. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_ps.py: clean up the code a lot.  Change the
           PostScript output to be more DSC compliant.  All
           definitions for the generated PostScript are now in a
           PostScript dictionary 'mpldict'.  Moved the long comment
           about drawing ellipses from the PostScript output into a
           Python comment. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_gtk.py: removed FigureCanvasGTK.realize() as its no longer 
           needed. Merged ColorManager into GraphicsContext
           backend_bases.py: For set_capstyle/joinstyle() only set cap or 
           joinstyle if there is no error. - SC

2004-10-30 backend_gtk.py: tidied up print_figure() and removed some of the 
           dependency on widget events - SC

2004-10-28 backend_cairo.py: The renderer is complete except for mathtext,
           draw_image() and clipping. gtkcairo works reasonably well. cairo
           does not yet create any files since I can't figure how to set the
           'target surface', I don't think pycairo wraps the required functions
	   - SC

2004-10-28 backend_gtk.py: Improved the save dialog (GTK 2.4 only) so it 
           presents the user with a menu of supported image formats - SC

2004-10-28 backend_svg.py: change print_figure() to restore original face/edge 
           color
           backend_ps.py : change print_figure() to ensure original face/edge 
           colors are restored even if there's an IOError - SC

2004-10-27 Applied Norbert's errorbar patch to support barsabove kwarg

2004-10-27 Applied Norbert's legend patch to support None handles

2004-10-27 Added two more backends: backend_cairo.py, backend_gtkcairo.py
           They are not complete yet, currently backend_gtkcairo just renders 
           polygons, rectangles and lines - SC

2004-10-21 Added polar axes and plots - JDH

2004-10-20 Fixed corrcoef bug exposed by corrcoef(X) where X is matrix
           - JDH

2004-10-19 Added kwarg support to xticks and yticks to set ticklabel
           text properties -- thanks to T. Edward Whalen for the suggestion

2004-10-19 Added support for PIL images in imshow(), image.py - ADS

2004-10-19 Re-worked exception handling in _image.py and _transforms.py
           to avoid masking problems with shared libraries.  - JTM

2004-10-16 Streamlined the matlab interface wrapper, removed the
           noplot option to hist - just use mlab.hist instead.

2004-09-30 Added Andrew Dalke's strftime code to extend the range of
           dates supported by the DateFormatter - JDH

2004-09-30 Added barh - JDH

2004-09-30 Removed fallback to alternate array package from numerix
           so that ImportErrors are easier to debug.           JTM

2004-09-30 Add GTK+ 2.4 support for the message in the toolbar. SC

2004-09-30 Made some changes to support python22 - lots of doc
           fixes. - JDH

2004-09-29 Added a Verbose class for reporting - JDH

==============================================================

2004-09-28 Released 0.63.0

           examples/print_stdout.py

2004-09-24 Reorganized all py code to lib subdir

2004-09-24 Fixed axes resize image edge effects on interpolation -
           required upgrade to agg22 which fixed an agg bug related to
           this problem

2004-09-20 Added toolbar2 message display for backend_tkagg.  JTM


2004-09-17 Added coords formatter attributes.  These must be callable,
           and return a string for the x or y data. These will be used
           to format the x and y data for the coords box.  Default is
           the axis major formatter.  Eg

	     def price(x): return '$%1.2f'%x
	     ax.format_xdata = DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d')
	     ax.format_ydata = price


2004-09-17 Total rewrite of dates handling to use python datetime with
           num2date, date2num and drange.  pytz for timezone handling,
           dateutils for spohisticated ticking.  date ranges from
           0001-9999 are supported.  rrules allow arbitrary date
           ticking.  examples/date_demo*.py converted to show new
           usage.  new example examples/date_demo_rrule.py shows how
           to use rrules in date plots.  The date locators are much
           more general and almost all of them have different
           constructors.  See matplotlib.dates for more info.

2004-09-15 Applied Fernando's backend __init__ patch to support easier
           backend maintenance.  Added his numutils to mlab.  JDH

2004-09-16 Re-designated all files in matplotlib/images as binary and
	   w/o keyword substitution using "cvs admin -kb *.svg ...".
	   See binary files in "info cvs" under Linux.  This was messing
	   up builds from CVS on windows since CVS was doing lf -> cr/lf 
	   and keyword substitution on the bitmaps.  - JTM

2004-09-15 Modified setup to build array-package-specific extensions
	   for those extensions which are array-aware.  Setup builds
	   extensions automatically for either Numeric, numarray, or
	   both, depending on what you have installed.  Python proxy
	   modules for the array-aware extensions import the version
	   optimized for numarray or Numeric determined by numerix.
           - JTM

2004-09-15 Moved definitions of infinity from mlab to numerix to avoid
	   divide by zero warnings for numarray - JTM

--------------------------------------------
This is the Old, stale, never used changelog

2002-12-10 - Added a TODO file and CHANGELOG.  Lots to do -- get
             crackin'!

           - Fixed y zoom tool bug

           - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem.
             The problem was that for solid lines, the y data clipping
             (as opposed to the gc clipping) caused artifactual
             horizontal solid lines near the ylim boundaries.  I did a
             5% offset hack in Axes set_ylim functions which helped,
             but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms.
             So I disabled y data clipping for connected lines .  If
             you need extensive y clipping, either plot(y,x) because x
             data clipping is always enabled, or change the _set_clip
             code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src.  See
             _set_clip in lines.py and set_ylim in figure.py for more
             information.


2002-12-11 - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to
             measure axes position and the delta x delta y with a left
             mouse drag.  These defaults can be overridden by deriving
             from Figure and overrriding button_press_event,
             button_release_event, and motion_notify_event,
             and _dialog_measure_tool.

           - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the
             navigation buttons apply to.



2003-04-23 Released matplotlib v0.1

2003-04-24 Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the
           markers as pixels (as small as possible) with format
           symbol ','
 
           Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle,
           RegularPolygon and Circle

2003-04-25 Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist
 
           Added a new line type '|' which is a vline.  syntax is 
	   plot(x, Y, '|') where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives
	   the ymin,ymax for the respective values of x.  Previously I
	   had implemented vlines as a list of lines, but I needed the
	   efficientcy of the numeric clipping for large numbers of
	   vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class
	   Vline2D which derives from Line2D

            
2003-05-01
   
   Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip

2003-05-14
 
   Added new ways to specify colors 1) matlab format string 2)
   html-style hex string, 3) rgb tuple.  See examples/color_demo.py

2003-05-28

    Changed figure rendering to draw form a pixmap to reduce flicker.
    See examples/system_monitor.py for an example where the plot is
    continusouly updated w/o flicker.  This example is meant to
    simulate a system monitor that shows free CPU, RAM, etc...
	
2003-08-04

    Added Jon Anderson's GTK shell, which doesn't require pygtk to
    have threading built-in and looks nice!

2003-08-25
   
   Fixed deprecation warnings for python2.3 and pygtk-1.99.18

2003-08-26

   Added figure text with new example examples/figtext.py


2003-08-27
  
   Fixed bugs i figure text with font override dictionairies and fig
   text that was placed outside the window bounding box

2003-09-1 thru 2003-09-15  

   Added a postscript and a GD module backend

2003-09-16

   Fixed font scaling and point scaling so circles, squares, etc on
   lines will scale with DPI as will fonts.  Font scaling is not fully
   implemented on the gtk backend because I have not figured out how
   to scale fonts to arbitrary sizes with GTK

2003-09-17 
 
   Fixed figure text bug which crashed X windows on long figure text
   extending beyond display area.  This was, I believe, due to the
   vestigial erase functionality that was no longer needed since I
   began rendering to a pixmap

2003-09-30  Added legend

2003-10-01 Fixed bug when colors are specified with rgb tuple or hex
   string.


2003-10-21  Andrew Straw provided some legend code which I modified
      and incorporated.  Thanks Andrew!

2003-10-27 Fixed a bug in axis.get_view_distance that affected zoom in
  versus out with interactive scrolling, and a bug in the axis text
  reset system that prevented the text from being redrawn on a
  interactive gtk view lim set with the widget

     * Artist now know bounding box and dpi
     * Bounding boxes and transforms handled by dedicated classes
     * legend in dedicated class.  Does a better job of alignment and
