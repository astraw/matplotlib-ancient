This package requires python 2.2+, Numeric and pygtk 1.99.x (which
requires gnome2).

If these dependencies are satisfied, just do the usual thing:

  > python setup.py install

I have installed and tested this on linux and win32, but in theory it
should run anywhere that Numeric and pygtk run.

Take a look at the scripts in the demo dir for examples of how to use
matplotlib.

comp.lang.python, which I read frequently.
