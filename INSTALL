matplotlib requires python 2.2+, Numeric and pygtk 1.99.16, which
requires GTK2.

If these dependencies are satisfied, just do the usual thing:

  > python setup.py install

I have installed and tested this on linux and several win32 platforms,
but it should run anywhere that Numeric and pygtk run.


Redhat Users:

  GTK2 became the default with the Redhat Linux 8 series.  If you're
  distro is older than that, you'll need to upgrade your desktop,
  upgrade your gtk libs, or upgrade your distro.


Windows Users:

   Windows users should consult
   http://www.mapr.ucl.ac.be/~gustin/win32_ports for information about
   pygtk for win32.  Basically, you need to install the GTK+ 2.2
   runtime and pygtk-1.99.16, both of which have friendly windows
   installers.  After you install the runtime, you may need to add the
   bin and lib subdirs of your install dir to your PATH.
