Scripts that require optional system configurations to generate scripts should
go here. The  figures will be generated in doc/_static, and will be named based
on the name of the script, so we can avoid unintentionally overwriting any
existing figures. Please add a line to this file for any additional
requirements necessary to generate a new figure.
