  AGG
      The Anti-Grain Geometry rendering engine, capable of rendering
      high-quality images.

  Cairo
      The Cairo graphics engine

  EPS
      Encapsulated Postscript

  FLTK
      FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
      UNIX/Linux (X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X

  GDK
      The Gimp Drawing Kit for GTK+

  GTK
      The GTK graphical user interface library

  JPG
      A compression method and file format for photographic images

  PDF
      Adobe's Portable Document Format

  PNG
      PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics, a raster graphics format that
      employs lossless data compression which is more suitable for line art
      than the lossy jpg format. Unlike the gif format, png is not encumbered
      by requirements for a patent license.

  PS
      Postscript

  Qt
      Qt is a cross-platform application framework for desktop and embedded
      development.

  Qt4
      Qt4 is the most recent version of Qt cross-platform application framework
      for desktop and embedded development.

  raster graphics
      Raster graphics, or bitmaps, represent an image as an array of pixels
      which is resolution dependent. Raster graphics are generally most
      practical for photo-realistic images, but do not scale easily without
      loss of quality.  See `raster graphics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics>`_

  SVG
      The Scalable Vector Graphics format.

  TIFF
      Tagged Image File Format

  Tk
      Tk is a graphical user interface for Tcl and many other dynamic
      languages. It can produce rich, native applications that run unchanged
      across Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and more.

  wxWidgets
      A cross-platform GUI and tools library for GTK, MS Windows, and MacOS.

  vector graphics
      The use of geometrical primitives based upon mathematical equations to
      represent images in computer graphics. Primitives can include points,
      lines, curves, and shapes or polygons. Vector graphics are scalable,
      which means that they can be resized without suffering from issues
      related to inherent resolution like are seen in raster graphics. Vector
      graphics are generally most practical for typesetting and graphic design
      applications.  See `vector graphics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics>`_
