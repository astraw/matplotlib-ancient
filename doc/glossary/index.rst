  raster graphics
      Raster graphics, or bitmaps, represent an image as an array of pixels
      which is resolution dependent. Raster graphics are generally most
      practical for photo-realistic images, but do not scale easily without
      loss of quality.

  vector graphics
      The use of geometrical primitives based upon mathematical equations to
      represent images in computer graphics. Primitives can include points,
      lines, curves, and shapes or polygons. Vector graphics are scalable,
      which means that they can be resized without suffering from issues
      related to inherent resolution like are seen in raster graphics. Vector
      graphics are generally most practical for typesetting and graphic design
      applications.
