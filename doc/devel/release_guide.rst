*************************
Doing a matplolib release
*************************

A guide for developers who are doing a matplotlib release

* Edit :file:`__init__.py` and bump the version number



When doing a release

.. _release-testing:

Testing
=======

* Make sure :file:`examples/tests/backend_driver.py` runs without errors
  and check the output of the PNG, PDF, PS and SVG backends

* Run :file:`unit/memleak_hawaii3.py` and make sure there are no
  memory leaks

* Run :file:`unit/nose_tests.py` and make sure all the unit tests are passing

* try some GUI examples, eg :file:`simple_plot.py` with GTKAgg, TkAgg, etc...

* remove font cache and tex cache from :file:`.matplotlib` and test
  with and without cache on some example script


.. _release-branching:

Branching
============

Once all the tests are passing and you are ready to do a release, you
need to create a release branch and configure svn-merge to use it;
Michael Droettboom should probably handle this step, but if he is not
available see instructions at :ref:`setting-up-svnmerge`.  On the
bracnh, do any additional testing you want to do, and then build
binaries and source distributions for testing as release candidates.


.. _release-packaging:

Packaging
=========


* Make sure the :file:`MANIFEST.in` us up to date and remove
  :file:`MANIFEST` so it will be rebuilt by MANIFEST.in

* run `svn-clean
  <http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svn-clean>`_
  from in the mpl svn directory before building the sdist

* unpack the sdist and make sure you can build from that directory

* Use :file:`setup.cfg` to set the default backends.  For windows and
  OSX, the default backend should be TkAgg.  You should also turn on
  or off any platform specific build options you need.  Importantly,
  you also need to make sure that you delete the :file:`build` dir
  after any changes to file:`setup.cfg` before rebuilding since cruft
  in the :file:`build` dir can get carried along.

* on windows, unix2dos the rc file

* We have a Makefile for the OS X builds in the mpl source dir
  :file:`release/osx`, so use this to prepare the OS X releases.

* We have a Makefile for the win32 mingw builds in the mpl source dir
  :file:`release/win32` which you can use this to prepare the windows
  releases, but this is currently broken for python2.6 as described at
  http://www.nabble.com/binary-installers-for-python2.6--libpng-segfault%2C-MSVCR90.DLL-and-%09mingw-td23971661.html

.. _release-candidate-testing:

Release candidate testing:
============================

Post the release candidates to
http://matplotlib.sf.net/release-candidates and post a message to
matplotlib-users and devel requesting testing.  To post to the server,
you can do::

    > scp somefile.tgz jdh2358,matplotlib@shell.sf.net:/home/groups/m/ma/matplotlib/htdocs/release-candidates/

replacing 'jdh2358' with your sourceforge login.


Any changes to fix bugs in the release candidate should be fixed in
the release branch and merged into the trunk with svn-merge; see
:ref:`svn-merge`.  When the release candidate is signed off on, build
the final sdist, binaries and eggs, and upload them to the sourceforge
release area.


.. _release-uploading:

Uploading
=========


* Post the win32 and OS-X binaries for testing and make a request on
  matplotlib-devel for testing.  Pester us if we don't respond


* ftp the source and binaries to the anonymous FTP site::

    mpl> svn-clean
    mpl> python setup.py sdist
    mpl> cd dist/
    dist> sftp jdh2358@frs.sourceforge.net
    Connecting to frs.sourceforge.net...
    sftp> cd uploads
    sftp> ls
    sftp> lls
    matplotlib-0.98.2.tar.gz
    sftp> put matplotlib-0.98.2.tar.gz
    Uploading matplotlib-0.98.2.tar.gz to /incoming/j/jd/jdh2358/uploads/matplotlib-0.98.2.tar.gz

* go https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=80706 and do a
  file release.  Click on the "Admin" tab to log in as an admin, and
  then the "File Releases" tab.  Go to the bottom and click "add
  release" and enter the package name but not the version number in
  the "Package Name" box.  You will then be prompted for the "New
  release name" at which point you can add the version number, eg
  somepackage-0.1 and click "Create this release".

  You will then be taken to a fairly self explanatory page where you
  can enter the Change notes, the release notes, and select which
  packages from the incoming ftp archive you want to include in this
  release.  For each binary, you will need to select the platform and
  file type, and when you are done you click on the "notify users who
  are monitoring this package link"


.. _release-announcing:

Announcing
==========

Announce the release on matplotlib-announce, matplotlib-users and
matplotlib-devel.  Include a summary of highlights from the CHANGELOG
and/or post the whole CHANGELOG since the last release.
