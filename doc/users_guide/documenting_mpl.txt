Documenting Matplotlib
**********************

The documentation for matplotlib is generated from ReStructured Text
using the Sphinx_ documentation generation tool. Sphinx-0.4 or later 
is required. Currently this means we need to install from the svn 
repository by doing::

  svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools/trunk sphinx
  cd sphinx
  python setup.py install

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

The documentation sources are found in the doc/ directory in the trunk.
To build the users guid in html format, cd into doc/users_guide and do::

  python make.py html

you can also pass a ``latex`` flag to make.py to build a pdf, or pass no 
arguments to build everything. The same procedure can be followed for
the sources in doc/api_reference.

The actual ReStructured Text files are kept in doc/users_guide/source
and doc/api_reference/source. The main entry point is index.txt. 
Additional files can be added by including their base file name 
(dropping the .txt extension) in the table of contents. It is also 
possible to include other documents through the use of an include 
statement. For example, in the Developers Guide, index.txt lists 
coding_guide, which automatically inserts coding_guide.txt. 
coding_guide.txt is just a placeholder, it contains one line only to 
gets its contents from the CODING_GUIDE file in the trunk: 
``.. include:: ../../CODING_GUIDE``.

Mathematical expressions can be rendered as png images in html, and in 
the usual way by latex. For example:

``math:`sin(x_n^2)`` yields: :math:`sin(x_n^2)`, and::

  .. math::

     \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i\phi}}{1+x^2\frac{e^{i\phi}}{1+x^2}}``

yields:

.. math::

   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i\phi}}{1+x^2\frac{e^{i\phi}}{1+x^2}} 

The output produced by Sphinx can be configured by editing the conf.py
files located in the documentation source directories.

The Sphinx website contains plenty of documentation_ concerning ReST
markup and working with Sphinx in general.
