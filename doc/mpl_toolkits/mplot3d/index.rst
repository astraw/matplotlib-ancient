Matplotlib mplot3d toolkit
==========================
The mplot3d toolkit adds simple 3d plotting capabilities to matplotlib by
supplying an axis object that can create a 2d projection of a 3d scene.
In the end it produces a list of 2d lines and patches that are drawn by the
normal matplotlib code. Therefore the resulting graph will have the same look
and feel as regular 2d plots.

Interactive backends also provide the ability to rotate and zoom the 3d scene.
